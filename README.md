# Book Store Management System

## Book Store - Phase 1

This repository contains the code and commits for the first phase of the Book Store Management System. In this phase, the focus is on building a console application that implements the core functionality of the project.

## Project Overview

The Book Store Management System is designed to facilitate online book shopping, catering to two types of users: **Admin** and **Reader**.

### User Roles

- **Admin**: Responsible for managing the book inventory.
- **Reader**: End users who can browse, search for, and purchase books.

### User Details

- **General User Information**:
  - Username
  - Email
  - Password

- **Reader-Specific Information**:
  - Phone number
  - Address
  - Payment method

### Book Details

Each book in the system is characterized by the following attributes:

- Name
- Author
- Price
- Available stock quantity
- Category

## System Functionalities

### Admin Capabilities

The Admin has the following functionalities:

- **Add Books**: Insert new books into the inventory.
- **Edit Books**: Update details of existing books.
- **Delete Books**: Remove books from the inventory.
- **View All Books**: Display all books, including those out of stock.
- **Search Books**: Find books based on various criteria.

### Reader Capabilities

The Reader can perform the following actions:

## Phase 1 Details

### Initial Development

Phase 1 focuses on developing the core functionalities of the Book Store Management System as a console-based application.

## Transition to Phase 2

After completing Phase 1, the project transitioned to Phase 2, where a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed. The codebase for the GUI can be found in the [book-store-gui](https://github.com/adamt-eng/book-store-gui) repository.

### Phase 2 Development

In Phase 2, the emphasis shifted to creating the GUI. The commits in the **book-store-gui** repository begin from a point where most of the core functionality was already established in this Phase 1 repository.

## Documentation

For comprehensive documentation of the final project, please refer to the README in the [book-store-gui](https://github.com/adamt-eng/book-store-gui) repository.
